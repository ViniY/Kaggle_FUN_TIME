# Kaggle_FUN_TIME
This project is focus on a kaggle competition, which focus on image classification, the code for now is using resnet. This model is quite popular currently, and it does get a very high accurarcy on this challenge. But there are several things should be changed, such us the way for sampling the data, and meanwhile I think this project needs more preprocessings.
